# Idea
A controller for [wordclock}(https://www.printables.com/de/model/331012-wordclock-16x16-led-matrix)
cron executes a script (at night) that sets the text for the next day.

## clockctl
A shell script that is just a thin wrapper around the bad clock web api

## update-clock-message.py
### Option 1
Uses CalDav to download multiple calendars.
Each calendar is for one type of message.
E.g. the calendar called "trash" is for the events for trash.
Another calendar "birthday" would have brithdays in it.

### Option 2
Downloads a single calendar via requests.
The name of the inidvidual events determine what message to show.
